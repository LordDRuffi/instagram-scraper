# instagram-scraper
scrapes medias, likes, followers, tags and all metadata. Inspired by instagram-php-scraper,bot


This repo is the same as the original one but I added additional functionality to the getFollowers() Functions so I am able to just stop the process of getting new followers if the maxInList ist satisfied

Also deleted the readme.md and changed the setup.py so it doesnt have a description anymore because there was some strange encoding error happening I didnt want to be bothered with.
